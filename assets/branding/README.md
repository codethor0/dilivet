# DiliVet Branding Assets

These PNG assets are intended for use in documentation, release notes, and
repository previews. Replace them with the final production artwork if new
branding revisions are supplied.

## Files

- `dilivet-logo.png` – square icon suitable for avatars and app icons.
- `dilivet-banner.png` – wide banner used at the top of the main README.

## Usage

Keep the files in this folder so build tooling can opt-out when necessary
(see `.dockerignore`). The distributed binaries and Docker images do not
ship these branding assets.
