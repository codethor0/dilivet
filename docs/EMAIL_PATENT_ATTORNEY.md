## Email Template

**Subject:** DiliVet – ML-DSA diagnostics toolkit patent package ready for review

**To:** [Patent Attorney Name / patents@paloaltonetworks.com / External Firm]

**Body:**

Hi [Name/Team],

I've completed a full documentation package for a potential patent around DiliVet, a diagnostics and vetting toolkit for ML-DSA (Dilithium-like) signature implementations.

The package currently includes:

**docs/INVENTION_DISCLOSURE.md**  
Technical disclosure intended for internal use, with:
- Problem statement and motivation
- Architecture and core components
- 5 core innovations with technical detail
- Novelty analysis and prior art considerations
- Commercial applications and use cases

**docs/PATENT_DRAFT.md**  
A formal patent-style draft including:
- Abstract, background, and detailed description
- System and method descriptions
- 7 formal patent claims (5 independent, 2 dependent)
- Industrial applicability and example embodiments
- Notes and questions for the patent attorney

**docs/PATENT_SUMMARY.md**  
An executive summary and quick reference with:
- High-level overview of the 5 innovations
- Plain-language summary of the claims
- Differentiation from prior art
- A checklist for next steps

The current codebase is open source (v0.2.3) and lives at:  
https://github.com/codethor0/dilivet

**What I would like from you:**

1. **Patentability assessment** of the 5 core innovations and proposed claims.

2. **Filing strategy guidance** on whether to:
   - File a provisional application first, or
   - Go directly to a non-provisional filing.

3. **Claim refinement** suggestions on narrowing, strengthening, or restructuring the claims to avoid obvious prior art and maximize coverage.

4. **International filing strategy** recommendations (e.g., PCT) if this looks promising enough to pursue beyond a single jurisdiction.

If it helps, I can also provide a short live walkthrough of the toolkit and architecture.

Please let me know what additional information you need, and how you'd like to proceed.

Best regards,  
Thor Thor

## Alternative: Internal PAN Patents Team Version

**Subject:** DiliVet – ML-DSA diagnostics toolkit patent package ready for review

**To:** patents@paloaltonetworks.com

**Body:**

Hi PAN Patents Team,

I've completed a full documentation package for a potential patent around DiliVet, an open source diagnostics and vetting toolkit for ML-DSA (Dilithium-like) signature implementations that I've been developing.

**Background:**
DiliVet addresses a gap in post-quantum cryptography testing by providing specialized diagnostics for ML-DSA implementations. The toolkit focuses on reproducible testing, adversarial edge case generation, and interoperability validation—areas not well covered by existing tools.

**Documentation Package:**
The package includes three documents (all in `docs/` directory of the repo):

1. **INVENTION_DISCLOSURE.md** - Technical disclosure with 5 core innovations
2. **PATENT_DRAFT.md** - Formal patent draft with 7 claims
3. **PATENT_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary and review checklist

Repository: https://github.com/codethor0/dilivet

**What I need:**
1. Patentability assessment of the 5 core innovations
2. Guidance on provisional vs. non-provisional filing strategy
3. Claim refinement suggestions
4. International filing strategy recommendations (PCT)

The codebase is open source (MIT license), so we'll need to consider how patent protection aligns with open source distribution.

I'm happy to schedule a brief walkthrough or provide any additional information you need.

Thanks,  
Thor Thor

## Follow-Up Questions to Prepare For

The attorney may ask:

1. **Prior Art Search:** Have you conducted a prior art search? (Answer: Not yet, would like guidance on this)

2. **Implementation Status:** Are all claimed features fully implemented? (Answer: Yes, all 5 innovations are implemented in v0.2.3)

3. **Open Source Strategy:** How does patent protection align with MIT license? (Answer: Patent provides defensive protection; open source distribution can continue)

4. **Commercial Intent:** Is this for defensive protection or commercialization? (Answer: Both—defensive protection and potential productization opportunities)

5. **Timeline:** What's the urgency for filing? (Answer: Would like to establish priority date soon, but flexible on timeline)

6. **Budget:** What's the budget for filing? (Answer: [To be determined based on organization's patent budget])
