# Governance

## Project Leadership

**Maintainer:** @codethor0  
**Decision Model:** Benevolent Dictator (BD) with community input

## Roles

- **Maintainer:** Merge PRs, cut releases, set roadmap, manage security advisories
- **Contributor:** Anyone who opens PRs, issues, or provides feedback
- **Committer:** Trusted contributors with merge rights (none currently; future role)

## Becoming a Maintainer

1. Consistent high-quality PRs over 6+ months
2. Demonstrated understanding of project goals and ML-DSA domain
3. Active participation in code review and issue triage
4. Nomination by current maintainer, approval via consensus (if multiple maintainers exist)

## Decision-Making

- **Code changes:** PR + tests + maintainer approval
- **Breaking changes:** Discuss in issue first; require CHANGELOG entry and major version bump
- **Security fixes:** Private advisory → patch → coordinated disclosure
- **Roadmap:** Maintainer sets direction; community input welcome via Discussions or issues

## Amendments

This governance doc may be updated via PR to `main`. Maintainer has final say but seeks community feedback for significant changes.
